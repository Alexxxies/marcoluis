**Hi,**

Upon investigation, we have confirmed that there is no issue or duplication of the invoice.

The root cause of the discrepancy is that the amount was split equally into two JBPs. The total GBP amount excluding taxes is 81.50, which results in two invoice items each showing a value of 40.51, as reflected in the attachment \[GBP-Amount-Total.png].

Additionally, there were changes made to the **Contract Payment Date** in the record \[JBP1.png] â€” it was updated from **12/1/2024** to **1/1/2025**, and finally to **3/1/2025**. In comparison, the other JBP record remains originally set to **3/1/2025** \[JBP2.png].

Kindly review the attached screenshots. If you need further clarification, please don't hesitate to reach out. I will now proceed to close the ticket. You may reopen it within **three (3) business days** should there be any additional concerns.

**Thank you!**
